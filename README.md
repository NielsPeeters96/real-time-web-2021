## 🔦 **Spike**
I thought it would be fun to choose for the puzzle concept and use it for my final assignment. I looked for an API for this as it is a requirement for this lecture. Unfortunately I have not found a suitable API for this and switched to the Twitter idea. For this I had to sign up for the developer portal on Twitter and waited for amy application review. This eventually worked out and now I can continue with my end product.

## 💼 **Use case**
Companies can analyze data with selected keywords and use this to see how they are known on Twitter. Every time a certain keyword is talked about, it is automatically added to the Feed. In addition, companies can also see which tags are used most, so that they can respond to this with future campaignes and promotions.
